Project Introduction

Our database project is an interactive web-based trivia game. The application provides a platform for users to sharpen their trivia skills and challenge others with self-generated questions that are posted to the community for any user to enjoy. Each user creates a personalized account in which they can create, share, and view trivia questions made by themselves or other users. The site focuses on the giving users the freedom to make and develop their own questions, categories, and games, fine tuning the various attributes to showcase a user’s expertise and creativityin particular area. 

Gameplay

The trivia game is formatted similar to Jeopardy, in that a question is associated with a specific category, difficulty level, and worth a certain number of points, each of these attributes chosen by the user. These questions are compiled together and added to a “game” that can be played by anyone in the online community. 
When a user chooses to start a game, a question will appear on the screen along with a text box for a response. As they answer the questions, their score will be calculated and returned when they finish the game.   

Data

Each user will have their data stored in the phpMyAdmin database. Their sensitive data such as password will be encrypted to safeguard this information. Additionally, each category, question, and game will be stored in the site database to be pulled as needed when games are played.  

Requirements

The application will allow a user to create a customizable account and generate and play various trivia games. This includes the ability to select a category, difficulty level, and point value for each question. The interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.

The user can login to their own account with their password safely encrypted in the database.
